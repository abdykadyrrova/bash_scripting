# Description:
I want a small program to locate my repository I want to 
work on and take me there. It should also prevent us from 
silly errors.

Step 1: 
Fisrt we locate our repository using the built-in
linux command "find"

Step 2: 
Take input as $1 to locate a specific repository.
If there is no input, we will print out error message. 

Step 3:
We will save the output of the "find" command and 
"change directory" to the repository 

Step 4:
Before the bash process is eliminated, we take over.
